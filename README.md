# The-Greatest-Depression
Immerse yourself in the world of the 1930s as you play through the story of John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men. 
You play as George Milton and have to withstand the harsh conditions of the time period in 4 difficult levels. Although the game is pretty comical and joke-y, the difficulty and struggles you will face are meant to embody live back then. Rage-quitting the game would be the same as rage-quitting life during the depression.
How long can you last before you and all of your dreams and ambitions die in the face of danger?
